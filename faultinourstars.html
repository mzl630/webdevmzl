<h4 style="color:black";>Plot</h4>
<p>
Hazel Grace Lancaster is an intelligent and sarcastic Indianapolis teenager coping with terminal thyroid cancer that has metastasized 
to her lungs. Believing her to be depressed, Hazel's mother urges her to attend a cancer patients' support group at a local church 
to make friends. During a support meeting, Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a teen who had suffered from osteosarcoma that had caused 
him to lose his leg. After the meeting Augustus invites Hazel to his house, where they bond over their similar interests and views 
on cancer. Before she leaves, they agree to read each other's favorite novels. Hazel recommends to Augustus An Imperial Affliction,
a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter van Houten, had retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and had not been heard from since.
</p>
<p>
Weeks later, Augustus reveals to Hazel that he has tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and, through her, has managed to 
start e-mail correspondence with Van Houten. Hazel writes to van Houten with questions regarding the novel's ambiguous ending, to 
which van Houten replies explaining that he can only answer Hazel in person. Hazel proposes the trip to her mother, but the idea is
rejected because of financial and medical constraints. Later, Augustus surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam, obtained through
a charitable foundation similar to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, namely The Genie Foundation.
</p>
Days before the trip, Hazel suffers an episode of pleural effusion and is sent to the ICU, prompting her doctors to question the 
safety of overseas travel. The medical team argues against the trip but eventually comply with Hazel's wishes and persuade her 
parents to allow the trip. When Hazel and Augustus first arrive in Amsterdam, they go to a restaurant and find out that Van Houten
had paid for a meal and champagne for them. Augustus then confesses his love for Hazel that night. Hazel and Augustus finally meet 
van Houten, but are shocked to find that, instead of a prolific genius, he is a mean-spirited drunk. Lidewij confesses to having 
arranged the meeting on his behalf, angering van Houten, who proceeds to insult Hazel's cancer and refuses to answer any of her 
questions. The two leave the author angry and disappointed.
<p>
Accompanied by Lidewij, Hazel and Augustus visit the Anne Frank House. Hazel struggles to climb the many stairs leading up to 
the attic but by the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel share a romantic kiss, followed by applause from the other tourists in 
the attic. They return to the hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day, Augustus confesses that a recent PET scan had
revealed that his cancer had relapsed. Resolute, the two affirm their love and support for each other. Upon their return to 
Indianapolis, Augustus' health significantly worsens. He ends up in the ICU for a few days and realizes that he is really in 
his final days. Augustus invites Isaac, his blind best friend, and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they speak his eulogies. 
Hazel quotes van Houten about "larger and smaller infinities" and confides that she would not trade their short time together 
for anything in the world. Augustus dies eight days later.
</p>
<p>
At the funeral, Hazel is astonished to find van Houten in attendance. He explains that he and Augustus maintained correspondence 
after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he make up for ruining their trip by attending his funeral. He confides in Hazel 
that his novel is based on his own daughter, Anna, who died from cancer at a young age. In an attempt to obtain forgiveness, 
Van Houten tries to reveal the fate of Anna's mother and gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior, 
crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, while talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten 
for assistance in writing his eulogy. Realizing what van Houten had given her, she retrieves the crumpled paper and reads 
Augustus' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel, a sentiment she reciprocates. The film ends with 
Hazel lying on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars; smiling as she remembers Augustus and says, "Okay."

<h4 id="double">Enco Review:</h4>
<article>
<p>
This movie I know was supposed to be sappy when I first saw it advertised.  A girl sick who falls in love with a boy, by impression. 
I only learned of the boy's sickness as I was watching the movie as a rental on a plane.  When I found this to be apart of the plot
line I was surely in for a tear-jerking experience.  You can't help but feel sorry for the kids in the movie, and while it was sad
I couldn't help but feel this was missing something.  The chemistry between the character was believable and the emotion the actors
portrayed was quite good.  In the end I was glad I had rented it rather than seeing it in the theaters.
