<h4 style="color:black";>Plot</h4>
<p>
Mac 
(<a href="sethrogen.html" title="Seth Rogan" target="_blank">Seth Rogen</a>) and Kelly Radner 
(<a href="rosebyrne.html" title="Rose Byrne" target="_blank">Rose Byrne</a>) are a young couple with a newborn daughter. 
The restrictions of parenthood make it difficult for them to maintain their old lifestyle, which alienates them from their friends Jimmy Faldt (Ike Barinholtz) and his ex-wife, Paula (Carla Gallo). 
One day, the couple finds out that Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity known for their outrageous parties, has moved into an adjacent house. The fraternity's leaders, Teddy Sanders 
(<a href="zacefron.html" title="Zac Efron" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a>) 
and Pete Regazolli (Dave Franco), aspire to join Delta Psi's Hall of Fame by throwing a massive end-of-the-year party.
One night, the couple ask Teddy to keep the noise down. Teddy agrees on the condition that Mac and Kelly always call him instead of calling the police. 
To earn Mac and Kelly's favor, Teddy invites them to join the party, which the couple agree to. At the party, Kelly meets Teddy's girlfriend, 
Brooke Shy (Halston Sage), and Teddy shows Mac his bedroom, which includes a stash of fireworks and a breaker box that controls their power.
The following night, Mac is unable to get in touch with Teddy to ask him to keep it down. Kelly convinces Mac to call the police, but Officer Watkins (Hannibal Buress) identifies them to Teddy. 
The following day, Delta Psi constantly hazes Mac and Kelly. The couple goes to the college dean, Carol Gladstone (Lisa Kudrow), and learn that the school has a three strikes policy; burning down their old house was Delta Psi's first strike.
After failing to force the emphasis to move by damaging their house, Kelly manipulates Pete and Brooke into having sex and Mac gets Teddy to catch them. 
Teddy and Pete fight, which ends with a barbecue grill being rolled into the path of a passing car and injuring a professor, giving Delta Psi their second strike. 
To acquire evidence of Delta Psi's hazing schemes, Assjuice (Craig Roberts) stands up to Teddy to record him threatening retaliation. When Teddy instead shows him kindness, he reveals that Mac and Kelly hired him to spy on the fraternity, and also damaged their house. 
Teddy begins playing violent pranks on the couple.
Mac and Kelly send Teddy a counterfeit letter from Gladstone allowing them to have parties again, and Teddy begins planning their end-of-the-year bash. Once the party is in full swing, the Radners call Watkins to complain about the noise. 
Teddy finds a flyer about the party and deduces that Mac and Kelly made them. He stops the party just as Watkins shows up. Jimmy throws himself from the balcony to distract Teddy, allowing Mac and Kelly to sneak into Teddy's bedroom and restart the party using the breaker box. 
Teddy catches them and fights Mac, while Kelly lights one of the fireworks and shoots it at Watkins's patrol car to provoke him into action. Meanwhile, Scoonie restarts the party.
Teddy takes the blame for the party and convinces Pete to take the others and flee. Gladstone shuts the house down and Mac and Kelly return home, adjusting to their new lives.
Four months later Mac is at an outdoor shopping mall when he runs into Teddy, who is working as a shirtless greeter at Abercrombie & Fitch. The two greet each other warmly and Teddy tells Mac that he is attending night classes to complete his degree. 
Mac takes off his shirt and jokingly acts as a greeter with Teddy.

<h4 id="double">Enco Review:</h4>
<article>
<p>
While the plot was not the most original it took a "bad neighbor" plot line and gave it appealing twist.  Seth Rogen and Zac Efron shine in their roles as Teddy and Mac. Rose Byrne only ads to the shaningans that go on during the film.
It appeals to the adult audience with children as well as the young audience from the frat perspective giving it a laugh it up for all who watch the movie. I would recommend seeing this as a rental not a buy to own to your collection.
