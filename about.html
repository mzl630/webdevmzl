I was born in Eastampton, New Jersey. I am 31 years old, and a current student at Drexel University majoring in Computing Technology.  I am a student worker at the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia. My expertise comes from being a movie-fan, which is why I assume you are here.  I grew up from the moment I can remember going to see a movie
that I wanted more.  I did not have the luxury of the internet as a child to research the movies I saw.  I had to obtain newspapers, magazines, and even books.  I engrossed
myself in how? what? where? who? why? I loved finding facts and reviewing the history of movies or the actors even the people behind the scenes.  I always had a knack for 
remembering odd facts and quite often recommended movies for others to rent or watch.  The days of going to the video stores have long past but with the internet, and online databases of movies,
there are endless resources for finding out this information.  I want this website to be a place where movie fans can go and research and comment even on their own experiences, or feelings. 
Take the time to browse through my site, if you have any questions or comments please email me, I would love to respond!
